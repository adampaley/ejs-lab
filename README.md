## Introduction
In this lab, you‚Äôll construct a dynamic website for a fictional restaurant, ‚ÄúThe Green Byte Bistro.‚Äù This hands-on experience is designed to solidify your understanding of using EJS templates with an Express.js application.

## A quick note before you dive in
Don‚Äôt hesitate to collaborate with your classmates when working through labs.

If you get stuck during the lab, we recommend revisiting the lesson materials first. They‚Äôre designed to provide you with the information and examples that will help you complete the exercises.

## What You‚Äôll Build
You‚Äôre going to create a vibrant, interactive website for The Green Byte Bistro. This website will feature:

* **Homepage**: Displays key details of the bistro - name, address, and contact info.
* **Nav Bar**: Includes links to various sections of the site.
* **Menu Page**: Showcases the menu, sorted into mains, desserts, and sides.
* **Category Page**: Generates pages for each menu type, using route parameters for content rendering.
## Lab exercises
First, copy and paste the following data to be used in the lab above your `/` route in **`server.js`**:
```
const RESTAURANT = {
  name: 'The Green Byte Bistro',
  isOpen: true,
  address: '742 Evergreen Rd, Mapleview, OS 45502',
  phone: '555-321-9876',
  menu: [
    { 
      id: 1,

    },
    { 
      id: 5,
      name: 'Fibonacci String Bean Fries',
      price: 11.23,
      rating: 5,
      category: 'sides',
      details: 'Crispy and lightly seasoned string bean fries, served in a pattern for a fun twist.'
    }
  ]
}
```
### Exercise 1: Create a homepage
#### Create a view
1. Create an **`home.ejs`** file inside of your `views` directory. Once created, add the following boilerplate:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Home</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Home Page</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
#### Modify the route
1. Now modify the existing route that handles the homepage `/` request. Update this route to render the `home.ejs` template in response to a request.
üëÄ When you refresh your browser, it should now be rendering the `<h1>` with the content `Home Page`.

#### Send data to view
1. Using the `locals object`, send the `RESTAURANT` data from `server.js` to the `home.ejs` view.

2. Using EJS tags, update your HTML to display the restaurant details. Include `name`, `address`, and `phone`.

3. Update the `<title>` of your `home` page to dynamically match the restaurant name.

4. ***Level-Up:*** Include conditional rendering to add the line ‚ÄúYes we are open!‚Äù to the page if the restaurant `isOpen`, and ‚ÄúSorry, we are closed.‚Äù otherwise.



### Exercise 2: Create a nav bar
#### Create a Nav partial
1. Create a `partials` directory inside you `views` directory.
2. Inside `partials`, create a `nav.ejs` file.
Add the following code to `nav.ejs`:
```
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/menu">Full Menu</a>
</nav>
```
#### Add partial to `home` page
Add your partial file to the top of the `<body>` in `home.ejs`
```
<%- include('./partials/nav') %>
```
    üëÄ Refresh to see a new nav bar appear.

#### Create a new route
1. Create a new `menu` route in `server.js`

    * `GET` route to `/menu`
    * `res.render()` a `menu.ejs` view *(created next)*
#### Create a matching view
1. Create a `menu.ejs` view for this new route in the `views` directory.

2. Add boilerplate HTML to your new view:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Menu</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Full Menu</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
    üëÄ Test your new view in the browser. You should see ‚ÄúFull Menu‚Äù on the page.

1. Add your ```nav.ejs``` partial to your menu page.
#### Send data to view
1. Using the `locals object`, pass the `menu` array data from `server.js` to the `menu.ejs` view.

2. In `menu.ejs`, Use a `forEach()` loop, to render each of the menu items and their details to the page. Include `name`, `price`, `rating` and `details` for each item.

3. ***Level Up:*** Using conditionals, refactor your code to render the items under three separate `<h2>` headers based on the category of the dish- `"Mains"` `"Desserts"` or `"Sides"`.



### Exercise 3: Create a separate page for menu categories
#### Create new links in the nav
1. Add the following new links to `nav.ejs`
```
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/menu">Full Menu</a>
  <!-- new links below-->
  <a href="/menu/mains">Mains</a>
  <a href="/menu/desserts">Desserts</a>
  <a href="/menu/sides">Sides</a>
</nav>
```
#### Create a new route
1. Create a new `/menu/:category` route in `server.js`

    * `GET` route to `/menu/:category` that uses route parameters to determine the menu category being passed to that route
    * `res.render()` a `category.ejs` view *(created next)*
#### Create a matching view
1. Create a `category.ejs` view for this new route in the `views` directory.

2. Use `menu.ejs` as an example and add boilerplate HTML to your new view. Make sure to add the `nav` partial to the top of the page.

#### Send data to view
1. Using the `locals object`, pass an array of data called `menuItems` containing ***only*** items that match the `req.params` category to the category.ejs view. Best practice dictates that this data should be filtered *before* it is sent to the view. This can be done in the route handler with a `for loop` or the `.filter()` method.

2. Send the category name in the `locals` object along with the filtered menu data. *Level-Up: Capitalize the first letter for a better UI experience.*

3. Once in the view, use a `forEach()` loop, to render each of the menu items and their details to the page. Include `name`, `price`, `rating` and `details` for each item.

4. Add the name of the category to the `<title>` of the page and to an `<h1>`.
